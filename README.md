# Customer-churn-prediction

## Why Churn Prediction
As markets become increasingly saturated and competitive, customer churn prediction has become great concern to many businesses especially those in retail and services industry as customer churn creates the challenge of revenue leakage. Hence, it is imperative for companies to carry out predictive churn analysis for an early detection of customers likely to churn so as to mitigate the phenomenon by introducing an implementing customer churn intervention and retention strategies to retain their customers and therefore save the company from facing high losses in revenue.


## Purpose of project
This project is aimed at performing a predictive analysis to identify customers at the risk of churning for an equipment services and rental company that rents medical, scientific and technical equipment. 

## Project Workflow & Outcome
The analysis was conducted with 10000 records of customer data using logistic regression model. The analysis revealed that 19% of customers were at the risk of churn. A churn prediction model was developed with logistics Regression algorithm to calculate the churn rate upon new customer transactional records or data. The model gave an accuracy of 98% when validated on the test data. Then based on the churn model I created probability risk scores for every customer as well as a customer risk bucket with which I provided some customer intervention and retention strategies. Also, a churn model was created using decision tree algorithm which gave a lower accuracy of 81% when tested.
